Place the AskManyExtension folder into the extensions/ directory of your wiki
installation. To enable the extension with default settings, you must enter two
lines into your LocalSettings.php file:

    include_once('extensions/AskManyExtension/includes/SMW_AM_Main.php');
    enableAskMany();

There are two flags which can be set to control the functionality of the 
AskMany extension at this point in time: $amgAskManyResponder and 
$amgAskManyRequestor.

$amgAskManyResponder is initially set to true and allows for the wiki to 
respond to external queries for semantic information. Setting this flag to 
false will prevent your wiki from responding to queries from other wikis.

$amgAskManyRequestor is initially set to true and allows for the processing of 
the <askmany> tag to be parsed locally on this wiki. Setting the flag to false 
will prevent the processing of any AskMany queries in wikitext.

The extension is still under development and there are a number of new features
that will be added soon. If you have any ideas or bugs that you would like 
addressed, please contact the author at pattoe@rpi.edu
